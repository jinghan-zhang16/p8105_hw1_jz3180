## Problem 1

## Create a data frame comprised of:

  - a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 10
  - a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and
what doesn’t?

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens
when you try to take the mean?

## In a second code chunk:

  - convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result
    to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result

## Problem 2
